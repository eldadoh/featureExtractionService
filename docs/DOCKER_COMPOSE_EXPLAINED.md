# Docker Compose Configuration Explained

## 📚 **Question 3: Why do we need the uploads folder?**

### Purpose
The `uploads` folder is a **temporary storage location** for images during feature detection processing.

### Why It's Required

#### 1. **OpenCV File Path Requirement**
```python
# OpenCV requires a file path, not in-memory bytes
image = cv2.imread(image_path)  # ✅ Needs actual file
# cv2.imread(BytesIO(data))     # ❌ Doesn't work
```

#### 2. **Thread Executor Limitation**
```python
# In feature_detector.py
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = await loop.run_in_executor(
    self.executor,          # ThreadPoolExecutor
    self._detect_features,  # Needs file path
    image_path             # Must be actual file
)
```

#### 3. **Processing Flow**
```
User Upload (MultipartFile) 
    ↓
Save to /app/data/uploads/temp_abc123.jpg  ← Temporary storage
    ↓
OpenCV reads file: cv2.imread(path)
    ↓
Process with SIFT (CPU-intensive)
    ↓
Delete temp file: os.remove(path)
```

### Volume Mapping in docker-compose.yml

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data:/app/data           # Host data directory
  - uploads:/app/data/uploads  # Docker-managed volume
```

#### Why Two Volumes?

| Volume | Type | Purpose | Persists |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| `./data:/app/data` | Bind mount | Sample images for testing | Yes (on host) |
| `uploads:/app/data/uploads` | Named volume | Temporary processing files | Yes (Docker managed) |

### Docker Volume Configuration
```yaml
volumes:
  uploads:
    driver: local  # Stored in Docker's volume directory
```

**Location on host:** 
- Linux: `/var/lib/docker/volumes/voyage81_uploads/_data/`
- Mac: Docker VM's volume storage
- Windows: Docker Desktop's volume storage

### Can We Avoid It?

**Theoretically yes, but impractical:**

```python
# Option 1: Use in-memory with cv2 (complex)
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# Convert UploadFile → PIL Image → NumPy array
img = Image.open(BytesIO(await file.read()))
np_image = np.array(img)
# Then use cv2 functions directly on np_image

# BUT: Requires rewriting feature_detector.py (violates requirements)
```

**Conclusion:** The uploads folder is **necessary** given the constraint that we cannot modify `feature_detector.py`.

## 📚 **Question 4: Logging Configuration Explanation**

```yaml
logging:
  driver: "json-file"           # Line 89
  options:
    max-size: "50m"             # Line 91
    max-file: "5"               # Line 92
    labels: "service=feature-api" # Line 93
```

### Detailed Breakdown

#### 1. **`driver: "json-file"`**
- **What**: Docker's JSON file logging driver
- **Format**: Each log line is a JSON object
- **Location**: `/var/lib/docker/containers/<container-id>/<container-id>-json.log`

**Example log entry:**
```json
{
  "log": "INFO     | Request processed | request_id=abc123 status=200\n",
  "stream": "stdout",
  "time": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456789Z",
  "labels": {
    "service": "feature-api"
  }
}
```

**Alternatives:**
- `syslog`: Send to syslog daemon
- `journald`: Linux systemd journal
- `gelf`: Graylog Extended Log Format
- `fluentd`: Fluentd logging driver
- `awslogs`: AWS CloudWatch Logs
- `splunk`: Splunk logging

**Why json-file?**
- ✅ Built-in, no setup required
- ✅ Works with `docker logs` command
- ✅ Easy to parse programmatically
- ✅ Rotates automatically
- ❌ Limited query capabilities (no search)
- ❌ Not centralized (per-container)

---

#### 2. **`max-size: "50m"`**
- **What**: Maximum size of a single log file before rotation
- **Value**: 50 megabytes
- **Behavior**: When log file reaches 50MB, Docker creates a new file

**Example:**
```
feature-api-service-json.log       (current, growing)
feature-api-service-json.log.1     (rotated, 50MB)
feature-api-service-json.log.2     (rotated, 50MB)
```

**Calculation:**
```python
# Typical log entry size
avg_log_entry = 200 bytes  # JSON structured log

# Entries per file
entries_per_file = 50MB / 200 bytes
                 = 50 * 1024 * 1024 / 200
                 = 262,144 log entries

# With 100 req/sec
logs_per_request = 3  # Request start, processing, response
entries_per_second = 100 * 3 = 300

# Time to fill 50MB
time_to_fill = 262,144 / 300 = 873 seconds ≈ 14.5 minutes
```

**Why 50MB?**
- ✅ Balance between rotation frequency and manageability
- ✅ Easy to download/analyze (not too large)
- ✅ Holds ~14-15 minutes of high-traffic logs
- ⚠️ Adjust based on your traffic: 10MB for low, 100MB for very high

---

#### 3. **`max-file: "5"`**
- **What**: Maximum number of rotated log files to keep
- **Value**: 5 files
- **Behavior**: Oldest file is deleted when creating 6th file

**Storage calculation:**
```python
total_log_storage = max_size * max_file
                  = 50MB * 5
                  = 250MB per container

# For this project:
api_logs = 250MB
redis_logs = 10MB * 3 = 30MB  # Different settings
total = 280MB for all logs
```

**Timeline example (100 req/sec):**
```
File                     Time Range       Size
────────────────────────────────────────────
current.log              Now - 14min      50MB  (active)
current.log.1            14-28min ago     50MB  
current.log.2            28-42min ago     50MB  
current.log.3            42-56min ago     50MB  
current.log.4            56-70min ago     50MB  
────────────────────────────────────────────
Total retention: ~70 minutes of logs
Total storage: 250MB
```

**Why 5 files?**
- ✅ Retains 70 minutes of high-traffic logs
- ✅ Manageable storage (250MB)
- ✅ Enough for debugging recent issues
- ✅ Auto-cleanup prevents disk fill-up

**Production recommendations:**
- **Development**: `max-file: 3` (save disk space)
- **Staging**: `max-file: 5` (current setting)
- **Production**: `max-file: 10` or centralized logging (ELK, CloudWatch)

---

#### 4. **`labels: "service=feature-api"`**
- **What**: Custom metadata attached to log entries
- **Purpose**: Filter and identify logs in multi-service environments

**Access via Docker:**
```bash
# View logs with label filtering
docker logs feature-api-service --since 1h

# Using docker inspect to see labels
docker inspect feature-api-service | jq '.[].Config.Labels'
```

**Use cases:**
1. **Log aggregation**: Filter by service in centralized logging
2. **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana queries
3. **Alerting**: Route alerts based on service label
4. **Multi-tenancy**: Separate logs by tenant/service

**Example with ELK Stack:**
```json
{
  "log": "ERROR | Database connection failed",
  "service": "feature-api",  ← This label
  "container": "feature-api-service",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45Z"
}

# Kibana query:
service:"feature-api" AND log:ERROR
```

## 🔄 **Comparison: Redis vs API Logging Config**

### Redis (Simpler, Less Traffic)
```yaml
redis:
  logging:
    driver: "json-file"
    options:
      max-size: "10m"   # Smaller files
      max-file: "3"      # Fewer files
                         # No labels (simpler)
```
**Total storage:** 30MB (Redis is less verbose)

### API (Heavier, More Traffic)
```yaml
api:
  logging:
    driver: "json-file"
    options:
      max-size: "50m"   # Larger files
      max-file: "5"      # More files
      labels: "service=feature-api"  # Metadata
```
**Total storage:** 250MB (More API traffic)

---

## 🎯 **Production Recommendations**

### Current Setup (Good for Development/Staging)
```yaml
logging:
  driver: "json-file"
  options:
    max-size: "50m"
    max-file: "5"
```
✅ **Pros**: Simple, built-in, works immediately
❌ **Cons**: Not centralized, limited search, manual access

### Production Setup (Centralized Logging)
```yaml
logging:
  driver: "awslogs"  # or fluentd, gelf
  options:
    awslogs-region: "us-east-1"
    awslogs-group: "feature-api"
    awslogs-stream: "production"
    awslogs-create-group: "true"
```
✅ **Pros**: Centralized, searchable, long-term retention
✅ **Pros**: Alerting, dashboards, analytics
❌ **Cons**: Requires setup, costs money

### Hybrid Approach (Best Practice)
```yaml
logging:
  driver: "json-file"
  options:
    max-size: "50m"
    max-file: "5"
    labels: "service=feature-api"

# PLUS: Ship logs to centralized system via agent
# - Filebeat (ELK)
# - Fluentd/Fluent Bit
# - CloudWatch agent
# - Datadog agent
```

## 📊 **Monitoring Log Files**

### Check current log size:
```bash
# View log file size
docker inspect feature-api-service | jq '.[].LogPath'

# See actual size
ls -lh /var/lib/docker/containers/<container-id>/

# View logs
docker logs feature-api-service --tail 100
docker logs feature-api-service --since 1h
docker logs feature-api-service --follow
```

### Log rotation in action:
```bash
# Before rotation (approaching 50MB)
-rw-r----- 1 root root 49.8M Jan 15 10:30 <container-id>-json.log

# After rotation
-rw-r----- 1 root root  1.2M Jan 15 10:31 <container-id>-json.log (new)
-rw-r----- 1 root root 50.0M Jan 15 10:30 <container-id>-json.log.1
```
